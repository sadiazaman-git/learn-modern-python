    "### What is dynamic binding in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic binding in Python refers to the process by which the interpretation of a method or function call is determined at runtime, rather than at compile time. In Python, objects are dynamic and can change their properties and behaviors at runtime, which allows for dynamic binding.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Animal makes a sound\")\n",
    "\n",

    "    def sound(self):\n",

    "make_sound(cat)  # Output: Cat meows\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `make_sound()` function accepts an Animal object as an argument. When the `sound()` method is called on the animal object within the function, Python dynamically determines whether to use the `sound()` implementation defined in the Dog class or the Cat class based on the actual type of the object passed to the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic binding in Python promotes flexibility and code reuse by allowing different objects to respond to method calls based on their individual implementations, rather than requiring explicit type declarations or static binding at compile time."

    "### 2. What is a dynamically typed language?\n",
    "Before we understand a dynamically typed language, we should learn about what typing is. **Typing** refers to type-checking in programming languages. In a **strongly-typed** language, such as Python, \"1\" + 2 will result in a type error since these languages don't allow for \"type-coercion\" (implicit conversion of data types). On the other hand, a **weakly-typed** language, such as Javascript, will simply output \"12\" as result.\n",

    "Type-checking can be done at two stages:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Strongly Typed**: Python is considered strongly typed because it enforces strict data typing, meaning that the type of a variable is enforced at runtime and operations on variables are restricted by their data type. For example, you cannot add an integer to a string without explicitly converting one of the operands to the appropriate type.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Typing**: Python is dynamically typed, which means that variables are bound to objects dynamically at runtime. Unlike statically typed languages where variable types are determined at compile-time and cannot change, Python allows variables to refer to objects of any type and can change the type of a variable during execution."

    "There are several built-in data types in Python. Although, Python doesn't require data types to be defined explicitly during variable declarations type errors are likely to occur if the knowledge of data types and their compatibility with each other are neglected.\n",
    "Python provides `type()` and `isinstance()` functions to check the type of these variables. These data types can be grouped into the following categories\n",
    "1. None Type: None keywork represents the null values in Python. Boolean equality operation can be performed using these None Type objects.\n",
    "2. Numeric Type: There are three distinct numeric types - `integers`, `floating-point` numbers and complex numbers. Additionally, `booleans` are a sub-type of integers because boolean consider true as 1 and false as 0.\n",
    "3. Sequence Types: According to Python Docs, there are three basic Sequence Types - `lists`, `tuples`, and `range` objects.The `range` which we use in forloop is itself a data type. Sequence types have the `in` and `not in` operators defined for their traversing their elements. These operators share the same priority as the comparison operations.\n",
    "4. Mapping Types: A mapping object can map hashable values to random objects in Python. Mappings objects are mutable and there is currently only one standard mapping type, the `dictionary`.\n",
    "5. Set Types: Currently, Python has two built-in set types - `set` and `frozenset`. `set` type is mutable and supports methods like `add()` and `remove()`. `frozenset` type is immutable and can't be modified after creation.\n",
    "6. Callable Types: Callable types are the types to which function call can be applied. They can be user-defined functions, instance methods, generator functions, and some other **built-in functions, methods and classes**. Refer to the documentation at <a href = \"https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#callable-types\">docs.python.org</a> for a detailed view of the callable types."
